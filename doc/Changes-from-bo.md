## Affixed particles (བ བོ པ པོ མ མོ ན ནི)

We have been able to derive these rules from some discussions and inspection of a list of valid words, but we are not sure about them:

 * Dzongkha can affix more particles than Classical Tibetan, and it can do it after suffixes (ex: རྒྱལཔོ།, king).
 * The particle བ gets affixed as ཝ (ex: འཐུཝ།).
 * The particles བ བོ can be affixed only after suffixes ང ད འ ལ ར ས or when there is no suffix. Note that Classical Tibetan would not allow བ to appear after suffix ས or ད, but it seems allowed in Dzongkha (ex: འཕྲོསཝ།, བསྣདཝ།).
 * All other particles (པ པོ མ མོ ན ནི) can appear after any suffix, even when there is a second suffix (ex: འཐོམསན།).
 * There cannot be an affixed particles after these affixed particles, ex: རྒྱལཔོའི། is invalid.
 * Unlike other affixed particles, they do not replace the འ suffix (ex: མདའཔ།).

## Other fused forms

Looking at a Dzongkha Dictionnary, one can find the fused forms ནོརབུ།, རྫིབུ། and རིལབུ།. We do not know if fusing བུ with the previous word is exceptional or common.

## Other forms

These forms are also taken from a word list from the DDC:
